what problems do i need to solve?
1.clearing result when inputting new number after pressing equal button (solved)
used boolean value
2.when there is a second operator in the display, calculate the first pair,then add the new operator(solved)
another boolean value?
what should happen?
every operator input, check if theres another one already, if so, get the result then add new operator
by using what? boolean, loop, includes()?
boolean may be efficient, but prob need a lot of if statements since it may be in conjunction with result boolean from first problem

good news: this problem has been SOLVED
how? at first, when the boolean was true, it would go through the calc function, essentially acting like an equal sign and clearing the result when i pressed a new number, so i just set result to false every time secOpr was true, and it seems to work pretty fine!
3.error handling i guess?
what should be displayed when the user makes a mistake? an error message.
what to do when the user presses equal on a single number, it prob should stay, and not display an error
yet another boolean?
guess what i used another boolean, and it seems to handle the rigorous testing pretty well
what about other cases now?
i might just leave this as it is because most of the errors are because of the user, not me, so i'll just tell that it wont work, and that they'll have to try again


4.when user enters two consecutive operators, the last one should be replaced with the curr one (solved)
tbh i forgot to document about this, but basically i just added another eles if block checking if the last character is an operator or not.

5.adding decimal input (solved)
it is now day 2 of making this project, i added a button, and guess what? another boolean to stop users from entering mutliple decimal in a single number, at first when i added two float numbers, it turned into an integer, and turns out it was because i was using parseInt, so I googled and used + before the numbers so it turns it into a number, whether it was an int or float
